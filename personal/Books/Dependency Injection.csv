Feature,Constructor Injection,Field Injection,Setter Injection
Reliability,More reliable because of immutable variables,Less reliable,Less reliable
Maintainability,Constructor injection helps in identifying the list of dependencies and can easily be used to make the code more readable,"Since Autowired fields can easily mix up with regular fields, it gets difficult to track the dependencies of the class",Same as Field Injection
Testability,Mocking the dependencies become easier as they can be mocked and passed using constructor even without creating Spring Context which enables faster and cleaner tests,Mocking becomes challenging as creating mock beans and actual beans and shuffling between them becomes tedious,Mocking is easy as mock object can directly be set
Consistency,More consistent as whole application uses similar coding and injection pattern,Less consistent as Field Injections can be randomly included anywhere in the code,Less consistent as Setter Injections can be randomly included anywhere in the code
Flexibility,Less flexible as it imposes strict design rules in the code,More flexible as developers can add new dependency easily,More flexible as developers can add new dependency easily
Ease of code reviews,If any developer needs to add new dependency then he will need to update the constructors at multiple places allowing reviewers to easily detect the breaking changes,"Since dependencies are added as a simple field, there are chances that it can go unnoticed by the reviewer","Since dependencies are added as a simple setter, there are chances that it can go unnoticed by the reviewer"
Modification of code,More aligned to Open-Closed principle of SOLID principles. Any modification to the code for the sake of extension or adding new feature can easily be debated that keeps code cleaner,Freedom to add unlimited new dependencies,Freedom to add unlimited new dependencies
Cyclic Dependency detection,Cyclic dependencies can easily be detected and fixed using Constructor Injection.,Field Injection does not detect cyclic dependencies.,Setter Injection does not detect cyclic dependencies.
Performance,"Last but not the least, having constructor injection means all the beans have to be created in correct order of dependencies which in turn increases the startup time of the application","Since each object can be created independently and dependency is injected later using reflection, startup time is faster.","Since each object can be created independently and dependency is injected later using setter, startup time is faster."
